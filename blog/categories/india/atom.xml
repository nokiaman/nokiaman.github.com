<p>Nokia India is running a new Lumia 920 ad on television channels in India ( and aired during the ongoing India-Pakistan cricket series). Catch the ad below:</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3dNDUNYT1fY " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

<p>It asks you to "Get Ready to Switch". Yes, we are ready, but when is the device coming, already?</p>

<p>Nokia India also made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=535105919841681&amp;set=a.171274912891452.37577.115332808485663&amp;type=1&amp;theater">post on Facebook that it will keep its New Year resolution and bring the Lumia 920 soon</a></p>

<p>While it is good to see the ads, it is still disheartening that we only get to see the "soon" and no solid date on when the device will be released in India.</p>

<p>Go ahead Nokia, reveal the release date and then talk about keeping up the promise, please!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There have been reports going around the <a href="http://www.thinkdigit.com/Mobiles-PDAs/Nokia-Lumia-920-not-launching-in-India_11380.html">Nokia Lumia 920 may not be available in India any time soon</a>, at the least, not in November.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/lumia920.png" title="lumia920" ></p>

<p>The Lumia 920 availability in India is completely in the dark at the moment. Reports that Nokia is diverting global stock to "more favourable" markets like the US and the UK and limiting the stock elsewhere is discouraging. This is pretty sad news for all Lumia fans in India hoping to get their hands on the 920.</p>

<p>While India has traditionally been a pretty strong market for Nokia ( and Nokia consistently being awarded the most trusted brand in India), other manufacturers like Samsung and HTC have eating away at its marketshare. It is disappointing even from this aspect that Nokia is not quickly releasing the widely anticipated Lumia 920 in India.</p>
