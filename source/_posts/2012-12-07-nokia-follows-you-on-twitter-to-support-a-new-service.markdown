Nokia has come up with an [innovative new service called TweetSender](http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/12/06/another-reason-to-follow-us-on-twitter/). Basically, the service lets you sign up one or more Nokia devices ( that you probably own ) and it then sends you a DM ( direct message ) on Twitter when there are information available about the devices - like software updates, apps etc. 

This is a pretty innovative idea in my opinion. You tend to miss updates on Twitter, and this makes sure you get pertinent updates about your device directly from Nokia.

There is, what I consider, a huge flaw in this. Not in the service exactly or what it tries to achieve, but with how it achieves this functionality. Once you sign up for this, the official @Nokia twitter account starts following!

As much as a ego boost it may be for me to be followed by @Nokia, I wonder why they couldn't have use some other account for this purpose, like, say @TweetSender, etc. I am not an expert on Twitter terms and API, but I think it should have been possible. Why would you have your main Twitter account follow everyone who wants to be followed?

Neverthless, this is a good service from Nokia and I am sure many will benefit from this.
